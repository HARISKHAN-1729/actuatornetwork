    "Neural networks have been widely adopted in predictive modeling due to their ability to model complex non-linear relationships. Activation functions play a crucial role in these networks, influencing their learning capabilities and performance. While $\\textit{softmax}$ is traditionally used for classification tasks, $\\textit{ReLU}$ (Rectified Linear Unit) is favored in regression models for its ability to introduce non-linearity without affecting the scale of the output. This study aims to assess the impact of these activation functions in the specific context of torque prediction.\n",

    "I developed two models to explore the impact of different activation functions on performance. The first model, based on a previous paper, used the softmax function. For the second model, I introduced a variation by replacing softmax with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function, known for its non-linear property. Both models underwent identical training and evaluation to enable a fair comparison. The findings from this comparative analysis are intended to deepen our understanding of how activation functions influence the behavior and effectiveness of neural networks.\n",
